This repository contains all sorts of utils that could help you with Fiesta Online development.
All tools are written from scratch. 

Projects:
ClientLauncher - A custom client launcher that accepts IP & password hash for Zepheus servers
FiestaMapRender - Renders SHBD files / updated with bit-rendering (works 100% now)
FiestaShark - A Fiesta Online packet sniffer, requires winpcap (can be installed from here: http://www.winpcap.org/)
ShineTableParser - A custom parser branch from the one that's implemented in the server, a standard DataReader implementation of the SHN format
Unfinished Packets - Outdated packet analysis
FiestaOpcodeConverter - Converts older opcodes (ushort) into the newer byte-byte format (& other way too)

Credits:
Diamondo25 - Optimising FiestaShark, developing Zepheus with me
Astaelan - MapleShark base source
Tamir Gal et.al: SharpPcap developers
